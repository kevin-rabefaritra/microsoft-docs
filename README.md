## Introduction
As engineers, we've come across multiple situations where writing undocumented PowerShell scripts were necessary. Everytime I provided a PowerShell script, I'd save a copy on my computer for future use.
However, I understand the struggle of some organizations / engineers to find scripts on Microsoft external / internal documentation pages.

Thus I'll be sharing some useful scripts / guides on this repository.
