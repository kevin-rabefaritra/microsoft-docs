# PowerShell scripts
Hi! I'm Kevin, a Microsoft Exchange engineer for Microsoft Partners.
As a Microsoft Exchange engineers, I've come accross multiple situations where writing undocumented PowerShell scripts were necessary. Everytime I provided a PowerShell script, I'd save a copy on my computer for future use.
However, I understand the struggle of some organizations / engineers to find scripts on Microsoft external / internal documentation pages. Thus I'll be sharing some useful scripts on this Github repo.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me directly at kevinm.ra@hotmail.com.
